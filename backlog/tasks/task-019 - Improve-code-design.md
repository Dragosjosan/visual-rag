## Description

As an Software Engineer I want to use best practices in regard to software.
- The code needs to be clean, methods short and do one thing.
- The code needs to be pythonic.

**Current problems I spotted:**
- The current services are implemented through a method, which makes the service global using the `global` keyword. This is not a pattern I want to use. As example take the `get_search_service` method.
